## Acknowledgements
Like so many projects, this effort has roots in many places. 

I would like to thank particularly  Bazyli Brz√≥ska for his work on the project [Bash Infinity](https://github.com/niieani/bash-oo-framework).
Framework part of this project is largely inspired by his work(some parts copied). You can see his [blog](https://invent.life/project/bash-infinity-framework) too that is really interesting
